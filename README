Installation and Configuration
------------------------------

1. Ruby 1.8.7 - Download Windows installer for Ruby 1.8.7 from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ and install.

2. RubyMine - Download the installer for RubyMine from http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/download/. Install it with license. License information is provided.

3. MySQL 5.1 - Download Windows installer from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html and install. The root password must be noted down.

4. To run expertiza, do the following:

   a. Create a new project in RubyMine. Choose rails application while creating. We need to point RubyMine to  Ruby1.8.7 (to the bin folder, C:\Ruby187\bin) before this.
   b. If this is the first rails application created, then rails won't be installed on the system. On RubyMine, when the project is created, it gives the option to choose Ruby (give the above bin path) and rails.
   c. Click on the "..." button next to it, it will install all the rails. Choose rails 2.3.14. Choose pre-configured database - mysql. 
   d. This will create a framework with a lot of folders like app, config etc.
   e. Now copy these folders from the downloaded expertiza source. Copy app into app, etc. You will need to copy app, config, db, public, script, test, vendor, Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, Rakefile. Delete index.html from the public folder.
   f. Open command prompt and switch to the directory of the project (it will mostly be in C:\Users\abc\RubyMineProjects"projectname"). Run the following commands in the same order.
             - gem install bundle
             - bundle install
             - rake db:create
             - rake db:migrate ( For this, we may need to grant privileges to this db on mysql, command is - GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pg_development.* TO 'root'@'localhost'; )

This should have installed expertiza. Now run the development environment on RubyMine. Open http://localhost:3000 on your browser and it should come up. Credentials are admin/admin
